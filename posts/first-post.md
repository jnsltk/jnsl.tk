## So.. what is this then?

It's a blog, in which I'm going to talk about my thoughts and takes on the tech I use, about programming, things I learn as I progress as an SE student, and just my thoughts on life in general. 

## Ok but why

I've been wanting to create a blog for a while now. Whenever I'm learning something new, I spend a lot of time searching for valuable information on the internet. This can be hard, especially since actually valuable and good resources are hard to come by. 

Therefore, it seems like a good idea to record this knowledge and information once I found it, so that I can easily access it next time I need it. And while I'm doing that, why not make it public, so that everyone can benefit from it?

After all I have learned most things I know about technology and programming from the internet. As such, I have this feeling that I should 'give back', that I should also help others, the way others have helped me.

## What I'll write about

I have a few ideas for blog posts already. These ideas include, in no particular order:

- How I built this website
- Installing Arch Linux, and my configuration (i3wm, etc.)
- Configuring and using Vim (Neovim)
- Using tmux
- My tech setup
- New laptop (if/when I get one)

There might be more later, and maybe even things not closely related to programming and technology (like hiking or analogue photography).

## Epilogue

So that's it, this is just a short introduction of what's to come. I also just needed a first post, I didn't want to deploy this site with no blog posts.

¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Byeee
